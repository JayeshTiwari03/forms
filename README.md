# Forms
React App with controlled forms, test scripts available

## Cases
1. Create an app with labelled, controlled text inputs for First Name and Last Name, and have it display “Hello, {firstName} {lastName}!” in real time, as you type into the text boxes.

2. Create another version of the app from Exercise 1, with labelled text inputs for First Name and Last Name, but make them uncontrolled inputs instead. Create refs to the inputs, and add a Submit button that, when clicked, will update the display to reflect the values in the inputs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1. For running the app, use:
### `npm start`

2. To run tests, use:
### `npm test`

3. For production build, use:
### `npm run build`
